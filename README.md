## WHAT THE HECK IS THIS GAME?!

Picture this: It's Christmas Eve. You're Santa Claus. But instead of sliding down chimneys with presents, you're **BLASTING PROTEIN-CHUGGING DINOSAURS** who somehow survived extinction by spending 65 MILLION YEARS doing nothing but lifting weights and posting motivational quotes.

This isn't your grandma's Christmas game. This is a **BROWSER-BASED FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER** where you fight enemies that will literally trash-talk you about your gym routine while trying to end Christmas forever.

**No download. No install. Just open and play. Your teacher will never know.**

## THE LORE (YES THERE'S LORE)

*In the year 2024, a rift tore open between dimensions.*

*From it emerged dinosaurs - but not just any dinosaurs.*

*These were dinosaurs that had spent 65 MILLION YEARS in a pocket dimension with nothing but gym equipment, protein powder, and motivational posters.*

*Now they seek revenge on mammals. And Santa Claus, being the MOST iconic mammal of all time, must defend Christmas itself.*

*Armed with weaponized presents and unlimited holiday spirit (and ammunition), one ABSOLUTE LEGEND stands between humanity and extinction.*

*The elves are on vacation.*

*The reindeer called in sick.*

*Mrs. Claus said "handle it yourself."*

*This is DINO DOOM.*

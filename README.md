## 🎮 What Is This?

It's Christmas Eve. You're Santa. But instead of delivering presents to good little children, you're defending the North Pole against an army of **ABSOLUTELY JACKED DINOSAURS** who have been hitting the gym since the Jurassic period.

This is a browser-based FPS where you shoot buff dinosaurs with Christmas-themed weapons while they roast you with meme dialogue. It's like DOOM met a fever dream about protein shakes and sigma grindsets.

- No actual dinosaurs were harmed

## 📜 Lore

*In the year 2024, a rift opened between dimensions. From it emerged dinosaurs - but not just any dinosaurs. These were dinosaurs that had spent 65 million years in a pocket dimension with nothing but gym equipment and protein powder.*

*Now they seek revenge on mammals. And Santa, being the most iconic mammal of all, must defend Christmas itself.*

*Armed with weaponized presents and an unlimited supply of holiday spirit (and ammunition), one jolly old man stands between humanity and extinction.*

*This is DINO DOOM.*

## ⚠️ Warnings

- May cause excessive "just one more wave" syndrome
- Side effects include yelling "SKILL ISSUE" at your screen
- Not responsible for any gains lost while playing instead of going to the gym
- The Sigma Dino will judge your grindset

## 📝 License

MIT - Do whatever you want, just don't blame us when you can't stop playing.
